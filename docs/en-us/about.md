# About

## Intention
I'm [Panos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tusiji/), a UX designer working in the AR field. I've been involved in the design of many AR hardware and software products.

Over the years, I've browsed a lot of AR products and design resources, which I first shared on [Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/mylcl). For a better reading experience and to keep updates, I decided to build my own site to share them. This is the original intention of building iAR Design. I hope it will be useful for everyone. Thank you 🙏!

## Site Name
Previously known as AR Design Club, iAR Design changed its name through a domain name change (iar.design) on August 23, 2019.

## Feedback
If you'd like to contribute new content to iAR Design, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/Tusiji/iar-design/issues) directly on GitHub.
